# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June 2025*

## 1. Who We Are

FlyAway is a mental health and healing application built to help people process emotions, release thoughts, and find community. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## 2. Information We Collect

- **Account information**: email address and display name provided at sign-up.
- **Content you create**: thoughts, mood entries, messages, and audio recordings.
- **Usage data**: app interactions and crash reports (Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics).
- **Device information**: iOS version and device model — used only for debugging.

We do not sell personally identifiable information to third parties for advertising.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

- To provide, operate, and improve FlyAway.
- To personalise your experience (mood history, saved thoughts).
- To maintain community safety through content moderation.
- To send important service notifications (not marketing without your consent).
- To analyse aggregated, anonymised usage trends.

## 4. Data Storage

All data is stored securely using Google Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Auth, Cloud Storage). Data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest.

## 5. Data Retention

- Thoughts are retained until you delete them or they expire.
- Messages are retained until deleted by either participant.
- Account data is retained until you request deletion.
- Anonymised analytics data may be retained indefinitely in aggregated form.

## 6. Account Deletion

You may delete your account at any time from **Settings → Delete Account**. This permanently removes all your thoughts, messages, mood entries, milestones, and credentials. **This cannot be undone.**

## 7. Sharing Your Information

We do not sell or rent your personal information. We share it only:
- With service providers (Firebase / Google) necessary to operate the app.
- When required by law or to protect safety.
- In the event of a business transfer, under equivalent privacy protections.

## 8. Children's Privacy

FlyAway is intended for users aged 17 and older. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us personal information, please contact us immediately.

## 9. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data, and to withdraw consent for analytics. Contact us to exercise these rights.
